## Project Description: 
The objective of the project was to create needle-nose pliers to pick up a resistor sized part. These pliers needed to incorporate a flexible element that returns the pliers to its closed positon when not in use. 
  * Print-in-place models are 3D printed models that can work immediately after removal from the print bed
  * Some models are printed such that there is clearance between joints that require motion, however these do not always work well
  * Instead, dual extrusion is effective at incorporating multiple materials into a print, such as adding in TPU into the center of the pliers for actuation
  * This project incorporated dual extrusion of PLA and TPU to print-in-place needle nosed pliers.
